All selectors and their specificity

Specificity hierarchy
CSS has a set of rules that it uses to ‘score’ or assign a certain weight to selectors and this creates a specificity hierarchy.
Based on the weights, there are four categories in this hierarchy: 
- Inline styles 
- IDs 
- Classes, attributes, and pseudo-classes 
- Elements and pseudo-elements 

Inline styles:
Inline styles are attached to the elements within your HTML code like with the ‘style’ attribute. 
Inline styles have the highest specificity.
That means that rules that are defined as inline styles will be applied irrespective of other rules. 
For example, take these two rules that create a conflict in color styling for a p tag:
 <p style=“color: white;”> 
p{color: blue} 
The p tag will be colored white because it is declared inside the inline tag.

IDs:
Next in the hierarchy are IDs and by now you know that they are represented by ‘#’.
For example:
#div

Classes, attributes, and pseudo-classes:
Classes, and the attributes inside the selectors, come next with what is called the pseudo-classes.
For example:
- .my-class 
- p[“attribute”]
- div:hover

Elements and pseudo-elements:
Finally, elements and something you call pseudo-elements have the lowest position in the specificity hierarchy.

Calculating scores:
CSS uses the hierarchical model internally to calculate the specificity of the selectors used on a web page.
But often as the size of CSS code increases, developers unavoidably face rule conflicts.
In these cases, developers use the specificity hierarchy to calculate the precedence of CSS rules and to control the outcome of their web pages. 

Let’s explore a practical example of how to determine the score of a few selectors. 
#hello {} will be 0100
div {} will be 0001 and
div p.foo {} will be 0012

These scores will be calculated respectively for each element present inside the selector. The total score for these elements is then calculated and the one with the highest value has the highest specificity.

Example 1
p {} 
div p {}
div p.foo {}

p  => 1 element =>  0 0 0 1 => Score: 1
div p => 2 elements => 0 0 0 2 => Score: 2
div p.foo {} => 2 elements and 1 class selector => 0 0 1 2 => Score: 12

The third case has a total of 12 for the p tag and so has the highest specificity.
The rules for the other two cases are then overridden and the rules inside the third case are applied. 

Example 2
p#bar => 1 element & 1 ID =>  0 1 0 1 => Score: 101
p.foo => 1 element & 1 class => 0 0 1 1 => Score: 11
p.p.foo => 1 element & 2 class =>  0 0 2 1 => Score: 21

While the weights assigned from the hierarchical structure help in a systematic approach, there are a few more guidelines and rules that become important especially in cases when the score for the different selectors is the same. Some of these are:
- Every selector will have a score and place in the hierarchy
- In the case of selectors with equal specificity, the latest or last written rule is the one that will be applied
- In general, ID selector should be applied in cases where you need to be certain about a rule 
- Universal selectors have zero specificity value
